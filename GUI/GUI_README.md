Feature Request:
1. For charging mode, 5x4 grid for balancing current (data comes from CAN bus)
   2. it should be following same set up for Voltage, but in mA (for current)
   3. label the cells in a intuitive way, each individual box should have a tag number (c1 to c20)
   4. same for temperature, T1 to T18 sensor box
   5. 18 sensors on the actual board, also R1 to R20, but skip R6 and R16 (discharge resistor temperature)
   6.
