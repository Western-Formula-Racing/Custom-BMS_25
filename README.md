# 2025 Custom BMS
This repository contains Western Formula Racing's first successful custom BMS project, designed and implemented in 2025. The folder 'wfr25_torch_bms' contains the STM32 Cube IDE project; this is the program that is running on the BMS STM32 microcontrollers. Simply open the project folder in Cube IDE to load it onto the BMS. The 'Resources' folder contains documentation explaining the BMS topology, how it works under the hood, as well as how to maintain it.
